# Road Traffic Fatalities Analysis â€“ WHO Dataset
Dataset obtained from Wold Health Organization data repository and can be found [here](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.RoadTrafficDeathREG?lang=en).

# Project Overview

This project analyzes the WHO dataset on estimated road traffic deaths to uncover trends, and regional disparities. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization, this project provides insights into global traffic fatality patterns.

Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure accurate numerical data.
- Perform EDA to identify high-risk regions and key factors affecting road traffic deaths.
- Visualize trends using line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to highlight fatality distributions.

Tools & Techniques Used

- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
